# **🎮 My Awesome C# Guessing Game!**
Hey there! Welcome to my super simple guessing game built with C#. It's a fun little project to practice coding.
### **✨ What is it?**
This is a classic "guess the secret word" game played right in your computer's console (the black screen with text!).
### **🚀 How to Play**
1. **Run the Game:** Open this C# code in a development environment (like Visual Studio or VS Code) and run it.
1. **Enter Your Guess:** The game will ask you to "Enter Guess:". Type a word and press Enter.
1. **Limited Tries:** You only get **3 chances** to guess the secret word!
1. **Win or Lose:**
   1. If you guess the word correctly, you win! 🎉
   1. If you run out of guesses, you lose! 😞
### **📦 What's Inside?**
- Program.cs: This file contains all the code for the game itself.
- Comments: I've added lots of simple explanations in the code to help you understand what each part does.
### **🤔 Future Ideas (If you want to make it even cooler!)**
- **Change the word:** Make the secret word random each time.
- **More hints:** Give hints like "your guess is alphabetically before/after the secret word."
- **Difficulty:** Let the player choose how many guesses they want.
- **Score:** Keep track of how many times the player wins.
